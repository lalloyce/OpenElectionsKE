# OpenElections KE

**A citizen-led, transparent, AI-powered election results platform for Kenya.**

What if any Kenyan could independently upload, verify, and audit election results from every polling station — in real time — using a transparent, tamper-proof system?

**OpenElections KE** is an open-source platform that makes this possible using blockchain-inspired principles, crowdsourced verification, and AI-powered OCR.
