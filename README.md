# OpenElections KE

**A citizen-led, transparent, AI-powered election results platform for Kenya.**

What if any Kenyan could independently upload, verify, and audit election results from every polling station — in real time — using a transparent, tamper-proof system?

**OpenElections KE** is an open-source platform that makes this possible using blockchain-inspired principles, crowdsourced verification, and AI-powered OCR.

## Why This Matters

Kenyan elections — especially Presidential — are often marred by:
- Delays and opacity in transmitting results
- Limited public access to raw polling station data (e.g. Form 34A)
- Widespread distrust in centralized tallying

We believe in **open elections** where every citizen can participate in safeguarding democracy.

## What This Platform Does

1. **Preloaded Polling Stations**: Based on IEBC registry.
2. **Crowdsourced Uploads**: Anyone can upload scanned results forms and manually enter vote counts.
3. **Anonymous Verification**: At least 5 independent verifiers must authenticate before results are published. Until then, validators remain anonymous.
4. **AI Cross-Check**: OCR + LLMs extract vote counts from images and compare with manual entries. Discrepancies are flagged.
5. **Immutable Results Ledger**: Once verified, results are made public, immutable, and linked to uploader and validator identities.
6. **Transparent Dashboard**: Public results browser by candidate, constituency, or polling station.

## Example Use Case

- Upload a photo of Form 34A from your polling station.
- Enter the visible results into the app.
- The system uses OCR + LLM to extract vote counts and verify the data.
- 5 others from different devices must confirm the data before it’s locked in.
- Once confirmed, the result is public, immutable, and available for everyone to audit.

---

## Vision

- Empower every Kenyan to be a guardian of democracy.
- Create a trusted, permanent archive of election results.
- Enable real-time parallel tallying and cross-validation.
- Fight misinformation with open data.

## We Need Your Help

We're currently:
- Building the MVP
- Validating the approach
- Designing the database schema + OCR pipeline

### Looking for:
- **Developers** (Python, FastAPI, React, OCR)
- **Designers** (UX for transparency and trust)
- **AI Researchers** (OCR, anomaly detection, LLM tools)
- **Civic Tech Activists** and Legal Advisors
- **Infra donors** (free hosting, GPUs, or server credits)
- **Grant writers / open-source supporters**
